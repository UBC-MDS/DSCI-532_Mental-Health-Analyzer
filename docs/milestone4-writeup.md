## Major changed implemented in Milestone 4  

In Milestone 4, our team made two major changes.  

The first big change we made was to add an age histogram under the bar chart in the main panel. One reason for this change was that we wanted to add one more dimension for users to understand the bar chart. For example, when a user see a bar chart on tech workers' attitude toward their willingness to discuss mental health issues with coworkers, it would be helpful to show to him/her the age distribution of the respondents. With this age distribution, this user would know how to change the age slider filter to see the results for a specific age group. Another reason we made this change was that it was an achievable objective in limited time frame.  

The second big change we made was to add more countries to the "Country" filter. Previously, we gave only three options ("All", "United States", "Others"). Users could not see meaningful analysis results for any country other than the United States. It made this app less interesting and less useful. After receiving reviewers' feedback on this, we decided to list seven other countries to the "Country" filter. Because of this, we also changed how this filter was presented. Previously, it was a radio-button toolbox, which makes sense for a list of just three options. Now we switched to dropdown menu, which makes more sense for a list of ten options. Of course, this change didn't take too much of our time.  

## What we would do differently?

If we were to start this project once again, we would add a world map to show which countries are in our data set. We would use color code to demonstrate the number of examples each country has in our data set. This map will be put on a separate tab called "data map" on the app and it will give users an intuitive overview of the distribution of data points by country.

We may also add a function to compare the analysis results between countries. We believe our target users might be interested in the difference in attitudes between different countries.  

## The greatest challenges

In creating the final product, the greatest challenge we faced was that we found many areas for improvements but had limited time. For example, we wanted to add more charts, to add country comparison function, to add a world map, etc. Given the time constraint, we had to make decisions to give up some ideas, even the ones we thought could be very useful.
