# Functionality

This app is deployed at https://gilbertlei.shinyapps.io/dsci_532_mental_health_analyzer/. It can be accessed through any mainstream browser on PCs, cell phones or tablets. After opening the link, we can see the landing page, as shown in below image.

This landing page has two parts: sidebar on the left and main panel on the right. On the sidebar, there are four filters, using which we can filter the data for analysis. On the main panel, there are in total six bar charts. Each bar chart shows an analysis on one specific area related to high tech employees' opinion on mental health issue. Below are four screen shots showing how to use each of the four filters on the sidebar.

Usually, the six bar charts won't be able to show on a single page. We can use the scroll bar to scroll down the page and see bar charts that are not visible on the first page. Below image shows what we can see when we scroll down the page.
